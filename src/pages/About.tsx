            🤝Much of the animus and anti-jewish sentiment in our society stems from either misinformation or ignorance. You'll find, barring real extremists, most people are open to hearing new information and re-evaluating their stances as a result.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
            📚We strongly encourage and challenge you to take the knowledge and communication tips you learn in the course and share with your non jewish peers what Israel and Judaism mean to you.
